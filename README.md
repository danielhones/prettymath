# prettymath
A Python library for entry and editing of math expressions that look good

This library consists of two main parts: 
- PrettyExpression, a class that takes keyboard entry as input and creates a LaTeX formatted math expression from it.
- PrettyMathWidget, a widget for use in tkinter GUI applications.

The idea of this is to handle math in a way that looks like it was written by a human.  It is much easier to read, comprehend, and spot errors this way than in the typical way of dealing with math expressions on a computer.  Plus it just looks a lot better and is more fun to use.
