* Ideas
  - Keypress is an object already, pass it as is to mathparse
  - Write an Equation class that mathparse can modify.  Each equation in the program
    will be an instance of the Equation class.  Maybe call it PrettyEquation or something
    to distinguish it from sympy equations.
  - Maybe (this might be retarded) the cursor could be the pipe symbol. It wouldn't have to blink,
    and since everytime a key is pressed, the equation needs to be updated anyway, it shouldn't be 
    too much of a hassle to just make the cursor symbol move along with the edits this way.  Or that
    might be a stupid shitty hacky way to do it.  We'll see.

** Components:
   |--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | raw_eq:      | This is the equation stored as a string (or list, whatever is better) that is      |
   |              | the "actual math" equation.  Can be passed to sympy to solve. It might be          |
   |              | possible to make this pretty easily, if it's just the raw text in an entry field.  |
   |--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | tex_eq       | This is the version of the equation stored as a LIST that is formatted with latex. |
   |              | Must always be valid TeX, so no hanging tags or braces or parens. This could       |
   |              | maybe be an object itself, to help keep track of term nesting and all that.        |
   |--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | active_term  | This is a list of chars that represents the term that is actively being edited.    |
   |              | Should begin and end with left and right braces.  Terms will have a nested         |
   |              | structure.  Figure out a way to implement that.  Maybe have an active_term_depth   |
   |              | class variable or something.                                                       |
   |--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | cursor_index | This is the index of the item in raw_eq and active_term where the cursor currently |
   |              | is. Maybe this needs to be a list that grows according to the depth of nesting     |
   |              | of the active term?                                                                |
